-Refactoring-

In this assignment I found duplicate code that wasn't necessary. I changed the class of several elements to match in order to reduce the number of duplicate style codes in the CSS sheet. I then gave semantics to each element so that those elements could be more easily understood and correlate to the site layout. After this I was able to specify some of the style code to the semantics of some specific items that were unique to the page and didn't need to be defined by a class or id. I then included a needed id to one of the anchors in the nav so that it could bring you to that section of the home page.
